					<h1>Introduction to the Curriculum</h1>
					<p>Curriculum is the knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes that students are expected to be taught, regardless of where they live or their background. <br><br>Curriculum in each year is mandated and is what teachers use to develop their teaching and learning programs and from where assessment is drawn. Parents are encouraged to contact teachers if they have questions about the curriculum in any one year.<br>The Teaching and Learning Exemplar (the exemplar) has been developed by the School Curriculum and Standards Authority (the Authority) as part of the School Education Act Employees (Teachers and Administrators) General Agreement 2017 (Clause 61.1â€“61.3).</p>

					The overview of research provides further support to teachers in reflecting on their own assessment practices.<br><br>
					1. Assessment should be an integral part of Teaching and Learning.<br>2. Assessment should be educative.
					<br>3. Assessment should be fair.
					<br>4. Assessments should be designed to meet their specific purposes.
					<br>5. Assessments should lead to informative reporting.
					<br>6. Assessments should lead to school-wide evaluation processes.</p>

					<p><a class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Learn more" href="https://k10outline.scsa.wa.edu.au/home/assessment/assessment-activities"><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></a>  The sample assessment activities exemplify a broad range of strategies teachers employ to obtain information about their students' skills and understandings, and range from asking questions during a lesson to giving a formal standardised assessment. The activities reflect the Principles of Assessment and the assessment strategies outlined in the Ways of Assessing section in each Phase 2 and 3 syllabus. <br><br>A sample marking key has been provided with many of the tasks. These keys vary in their format according to the years of schooling and the assessment strategy, and should be developed by teachers at the same time the assessment activity is being developed. The summative marking keys are detailed and can be used at the end of a teaching cycle to provide additional evidence for reporting purposes.</p>

Some students will have progressed beyond the achievement standard; others will need additional support. The expected standard for each year is described as 'C' or Satisfactory.</p>

In addition, year-level syllabuses for Humanities and Social Sciences, Health and Physical Education, Technologies, The Arts and Languages remain broadly consistent with the Australian curriculum but have been contextualised to make them more suitable for Western Australian students and teachers.</p>
